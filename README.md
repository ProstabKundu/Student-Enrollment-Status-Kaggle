# Student-Enrollment-Status-Kaggle
Dataset :
A dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies.
The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course. The classes are coded as 0,1 and 2 in the dataset

Worked with student dataset from Kaggle containing 3796 rows across 42 categories 
Created and trained a XGBoost model with Scikit Learn after experimenting with all classification model in a multiclass classification Problem
Obtained an accuracy of 76% on test dataset, after experimenting with 10000 sets of hyperparameters there by predicting student class.(dropout, enrolled, and graduate)
